# BellyButtonDashboard
**Overview** : During the class module, we worked on the first part of the dashboard: the demographics panel, where a dropdown menu
will list the ID numbers of the all the volunteers. When a volunteer ID is chosen fromt he dropdown menu, that person's demographics
information, such as location, sex and age will be displayed.

Through this challenge, we will need to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. Specifically, the volunteers should be able to identify 
the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. 

Using our knowledge of JavaScript, Plotly, and D3.js, we will create:

1. A horizontal bar to display the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu on the webpage
2. A bubble chart that will display specific given labesl when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu webpage.
3. A gauge chart that displays the weekly washing frequency's value, and display the value as a measure from 0-10 on the progress bar in the gauge chart 
  when an individual ID is selected from the dropdown menu.
